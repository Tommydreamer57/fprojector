For a startup with limited resources, simplifying the architecture can help
reduce complexity and development overhead while maintaining essential
functionality. Here’s a more streamlined approach that prioritizes resource
efficiency.

### **Key Architectural Decisions and Tradeoffs**

1. **Unified Income/Expense Model**

   - **Decision**: Merge income and expense streams into a single `CashFlow`
     table with a type attribute (e.g., income or expense).
   - **Tradeoffs**:
     - **Pros**: Reduces schema complexity, simplifies querying and data
       handling.
     - **Cons**: May require additional filtering in queries but is manageable
       with a small dataset.

2. **Single Monolithic Backend**

   - **Decision**: Develop a monolithic backend using a single RESTful API,
     avoiding microservices.
   - **Tradeoffs**:
     - **Pros**: Easier to develop, deploy, and manage with a small team;
       simplifies inter-service communication and reduces infrastructure costs.
     - **Cons**: Can limit scalability as the application grows, though
       manageable in early stages. Transitioning to microservices later may
       require refactoring.

3. **Single Database System**

   - **Decision**: Use a single relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to handle
     transactional, user, and configuration data.
   - **Tradeoffs**:
     - **Pros**: Simplifies database management and reduces maintenance costs;
       PostgreSQL’s JSONB support allows flexibility for storing user-specific
       configurations.
     - **Cons**: Combining structured and unstructured data can impact query
       performance in complex cases, though manageable with careful indexing and
       caching.

4. **Batch Processing for Projections**

   - **Decision**: Use batch processing for complex financial projections and
     comparisons rather than real-time calculations.
   - **Tradeoffs**:
     - **Pros**: Reduces processing load, allowing for asynchronous handling of
       projections and enabling efficient resource utilization.
     - **Cons**: Users may experience a slight delay in receiving projections,
       but this is often acceptable for financial forecasts. Implementing
       background jobs (e.g., using Celery or a similar tool) helps manage this.

5. **Basic Visualization Library**
   - **Decision**: Use Chart.js for data visualization due to ease of use and
     rapid implementation.
   - **Tradeoffs**:
     - **Pros**: Fast to set up and maintain; provides standard chart types
       suitable for financial projections.
     - **Cons**: Limited customizability compared to D3.js, though this can be
       sufficient in early stages and later upgraded as necessary.

### **Simplified Architecture Plan**

#### **Data Model**

- **Users Table**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `created_at`,
  `updated_at`
- **CashFlow Table**: `cashflow_id`, `user_id`, `type` (income/expense), `name`,
  `amount`, `frequency` (e.g., weekly, monthly), `start_date`, `end_date`,
  `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Projections Table**: `projection_id`, `user_id`, `parameters_json`,
  `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Settings Table**: `user_id`, `settings_json` – allows users to store custom
  dashboard layouts and visualization preferences as JSON data

#### **Backend API Endpoints (Monolithic API)**

- **User Management**:

  - `POST /users/register` – Register a new user
  - `POST /users/login` – Login user
  - `POST /users/logout` – Logout user

- **Cash Flow Management**:

  - `GET /cashflows` – Get all cash flows for a user
  - `POST /cashflows` – Add a new cash flow (income or expense)
  - `PUT /cashflows/{id}` – Update a cash flow
  - `DELETE /cashflows/{id}` – Delete a cash flow

- **Projections**:

  - `POST /projections` – Create a new projection with specific parameters
  - `GET /projections/{id}` – Retrieve a projection by ID

- **Settings**:
  - `GET /settings` – Get user settings
  - `PUT /settings` – Update user settings

#### **Frontend Wireframe (Basic SPA)**

- **Dashboard Screen**:

  - **Navigation**: Sidebar with links to “Cash Flows,” “Projections,” and
    “Settings.”
  - **Main Area**:
    - **Graph Display**: Standard line or bar charts for income vs. expense
      trends, with toggles for different timeframes.
    - **Benchmarks and Alerts**: Quick view of key dates like projected
      debt-free dates or savings targets.
    - **Comparison Selector**: Allow users to compare different projections
      side-by-side in a split view.

- **Settings Screen**:
  - **Customizations**: Options for users to define which benchmarks to track
    and dashboard preferences.

#### **Deployment Strategy**

- **Backend and Frontend Deployment**: Host the backend on a platform like
  Heroku or AWS Lightsail, while using Vercel or Netlify for the frontend. This
  combination offers straightforward deployment and minimal setup for scaling.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed instance (e.g., on AWS RDS or Heroku
  Postgres), which allows easy scaling as the user base grows.
- **Background Jobs**: Run batch processing for projections using a managed task
  queue (e.g., AWS SQS, Celery with Redis).

### **Conclusion**

This simplified architecture provides the foundation needed for a functional
financial projection tool while balancing cost and maintenance demands. By
centralizing the data model and using a monolithic API, the team can focus on
developing core features efficiently without getting bogged down in managing
microservices.
