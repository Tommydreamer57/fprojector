### Response

---

Here’s a structured approach to the system architecture for your financial
projection application, covering the backend data model, backend API, frontend
wireframe, and key architectural decisions.

---

### 1. **System Architecture Overview**

- **Backend:** RESTful API with GraphQL layer for flexible querying, leveraging
  a microservices architecture for separation of concerns (e.g., user
  management, financial calculations, data visualization).
- **Frontend:** Single Page Application (SPA) built using React/TypeScript to
  enable dynamic dashboard customization and smooth, responsive user
  interactions.
- **Database:** SQL database (PostgreSQL) for transactional data and NoSQL
  database (MongoDB) for storing customizable configurations and projection
  data.
- **Data Processing & Calculation:** Background job processing (using tools like
  Celery or Sidekiq) for asynchronous financial projections and comparison
  calculations.
- **Data Visualization:** Use D3.js or Chart.js for data visualization,
  customized to render comparisons, benchmarks, and projections in various
  formats.

---

### 2. **Backend Data Model**

- **User Table**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `created_at`,
  `updated_at`
- **Income Streams**: `income_id`, `user_id`, `source_name`, `amount`,
  `frequency`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Expense Streams**: `expense_id`, `user_id`, `category`, `amount`,
  `frequency`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Financial Projections**: `projection_id`, `user_id`, `name`, `parameters`,
  `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Comparison Sets**: `comparison_id`, `user_id`, `projection_ids`,
  `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Settings**: `user_id`, `settings_json` for customizable dashboard settings

- **Relationships**:
  - `User` → `Income Streams`, `Expense Streams`, `Financial Projections`,
    `Comparison Sets`
  - `Financial Projections` → `Comparison Sets` via `projection_ids`

---

### 3. **Backend API Endpoints**

- **User Management**

  - `POST /api/v1/users/register` – Register a new user
  - `POST /api/v1/users/login` – Login user
  - `POST /api/v1/users/logout` – Logout user

- **Income and Expense Management**

  - `GET /api/v1/incomes` – Get income streams for a user
  - `POST /api/v1/incomes` – Create an income stream
  - `PUT /api/v1/incomes/{income_id}` – Update an income stream
  - `DELETE /api/v1/incomes/{income_id}` – Delete an income stream
  - (Equivalent endpoints for expense management)

- **Projection and Comparison**

  - `POST /api/v1/projections` – Create a new financial projection
  - `GET /api/v1/projections/{projection_id}` – Get details of a projection
  - `POST /api/v1/comparisons` – Create a comparison between projections
  - `GET /api/v1/comparisons/{comparison_id}` – Get comparison results

- **Settings and Customization**
  - `GET /api/v1/settings` – Get user settings
  - `PUT /api/v1/settings` – Update user settings

---

### 4. **Frontend Wireframe**

- **Dashboard Screen**

  - **Top Navigation Bar:** User profile, settings, and logout options.
  - **Sidebar Navigation:** Access to “Income Streams,” “Expense Streams,”
    “Projections,” and “Comparisons.”
  - **Main Content Area**:
    - **Graph Display Area**: Dynamic, allowing selection between multiple
      projection views (e.g., line charts for cash flow over time, bar charts
      for income vs. expenses).
    - **Projection Benchmarks:** Key benchmark indicators like “Debt-Free Date,”
      “Target Savings,” etc.
    - **Comparison Selector**: Dropdown or toggle to compare multiple
      projections.

- **Settings Screen**
  - Options to customize dashboard layout, data visualization preferences, and
    account settings.

### 5. **Important Architectural Decisions**

- **Data Storage**:

  - **Choice of SQL for transactional data vs. NoSQL** for configuration data
    will ensure efficient access patterns but adds complexity in maintaining
    consistency between the two databases.

- **API Design**:

  - **RESTful API with a GraphQL layer**: REST ensures simplicity and
    modularity, while GraphQL offers flexible data querying for complex data
    visualizations. This dual approach adds development overhead but offers
    significant frontend flexibility.

- **Data Processing**:

  - **Real-time vs. Batch Processing**: Real-time calculations allow immediate
    feedback for users but are resource-intensive. Batch processing via job
    queues may suffice for complex calculations, though it may delay results.

- **Frontend Framework**:

  - **React/TypeScript for SPA**: React provides a responsive user experience,
    but extensive dashboard customization may require optimized state management
    (e.g., Redux or React Query).

- **Visualization Library**:

  - **D3.js vs. Chart.js**: D3.js offers deep customization options at a higher
    development cost, while Chart.js can quickly deliver standard visuals but
    may limit customization. This affects both development speed and final
    product flexibility.

- **Scalability and Security**:
  - As a fintech application handling personal financial data, scalability and
    secure authentication (considering solutions like OAuth2 and JWT) are
    critical. Security measures may impact development agility and performance,
    particularly for data encryption and secure storage.

---

### 6. **Potential Tradeoffs**

- **Performance vs. Feature Complexity**: Providing extensive customization and
  projection features can create high processing demands, potentially affecting
  response time. Techniques like caching and async job processing can help but
  may increase system complexity.
- **Frontend Customizability vs. Development Overhead**: Allowing highly
  customizable views and dashboards means more state management complexity and
  testing overhead.
- **SQL vs. NoSQL Consistency**: Using both SQL and NoSQL databases can
  introduce issues with consistency and synchronization, especially if
  projections rely on real-time data from both data stores.
- **Security vs. User Experience**: Stringent security measures can slightly
  impact the UX by increasing latency and requiring additional user
  authentication steps.

This architecture combines performance and flexibility, balancing between ease
of development, scalability, and a customizable user experience. Prioritizing
clear communication and detailed project management for the frontend-backend
integration and data consistency strategies will be crucial.
